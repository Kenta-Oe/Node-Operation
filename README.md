Objective
This project aims to demystify the process of setting up an Ethereum node for beginners and enthusiasts who wish to delve deeper into the Ethereum blockchain technology. By the end of this guide, you will have a functional Ethereum node running on your system.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your computer:

Node.js: Download and install Node.js, including the npm package manager.
Git: Install Git for cloning the repository and managing updates.
Geth: Geth is the Go implementation of an Ethereum node. Download and install Geth.
Installation
Follow these steps to get your Ethereum node up and running:

Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ethereum-node-setup.git
cd ethereum-node-setup
Install Dependencies

bash
Copy code
npm install
Run Geth

To start your Ethereum node using Geth, run the following command:
bash
Copy code
geth --rinkeby --rpc --rpcapi="db,eth,net,web3,personal"
This command connects your node to the Ethereum test network (Rinkeby), enabling RPC interfaces.
Usage
Once your node is running, you can interact with it using the command line or integrate with other applications to deploy smart contracts, make transactions, or monitor network activity.
